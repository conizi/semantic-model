## Examples of C# models

To assist you in integrating your software into the conizi Fleetboard world, we have created some examples for you. Furthermore, [JSON examples]() are available if you do not want to use C# directly.

The example project is structured in the same way as the models. It is therefore structured according to traffic type land, sea, air or application area, such as archiving or accounting.

An example for archiving would be the PoD ([Proof of Delivery](xref:Conizi.Model.Archiving.ProofOfDelivery))
